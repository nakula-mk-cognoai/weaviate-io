Weaviate is a vector database. [Vector databases](/blog/vector-library-vs-vector-database) store data objects and vectors that represent those objects. When you import a data object, you normally include a vector representation of that object as well. The vector representation is also called an "embedding."

Later, when you work with the stored vectors, Weaviate uses a vectorized version of your query to search the vector space.

This guide discusses importing data that already has vectors. An alternative approach is to use a [vectorizer](../modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/index.md) model that generates vectors at import time. Queries have to be vectorized using the same vectorizer as the data objects. When you define your collection schema, be sure to define the same vectorizer that you use to vectorize the data.

Weaviate supports embeddings generated by popular third party services and custom vector embeddings that you create. For details on how to connect your client application to a vectorizer, see the follow pages:  

- [Supported models](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules)
- [Custom models](/developers/weaviate/modules/other-modules/custom-modules)

## Import data

Follow these steps to prepare your collection and import data:

1. [Connect to Weaviate](/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors/#connect-to-a-weaviate-instance)
1. Create a collection schema
1. Prepare a data file
1. Import the data
1. Query the data

### Connect to a Weaviate instance

This guide uses a free sandbox in [Weaviate Cloud](/developers/wcs/sandbox). If you don't have a Weaviate Cloud account, you can [create one](/developers/wcs/create-account) or else follow along on a Weaviate instance of your own.

#### Login to Weaviate Cloud

#### Create a sandbox cluster

To create a sandbox cluster, follow these steps:

import CreateSandboxCluster from '/_includes/wcs/create-cluster-sandbox.mdx'

<CreateSandboxCluster />

To connect to your sandbox instance, you need the following information:

- The Weaviate sandbox URL
- The Weaviate sandbox API key


Run the following example code to connect to Weaviate. You can re-use the resulting `client` object in the following steps.

import ConnectToWeaviate from '/_includes/code/quickstart/connect.noheader.mdx'

<ConnectToWeaviate />

### Create a collection schema
### Prepare a data file
### Import the data
### Query the data


## Data

We'll use as an example a tiny dataset consisting of 10 questions from the popular quiz show "Jeopardy!". Each object has an associated vector embedding.

In this example, these vectors were obtained through an OpenAI API, using the <nobr>[`text-embedding-ada-002` model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)</nobr>. But your vectors can come from any source, such as another inference service provider (e.g Cohere or Hugging Face) or your own fine-tuned model.

## Client library

For the best experience with Weaviate, we recommend installing a Weaviate client library for one of these languages:

import CodeClientInstall from '/_includes/code/quickstart/clients.install.mdx';

<CodeClientInstall />

For JavaScript/TypeScript, we'll also need the `node-fetch` library to download the dataset, so make sure to `npm install node-fetch`.


## Collection definition

Weaviate [stores data](../concepts/data.md) objects in collections, each of which is called a `class`. Each object has a set of properties, and a vector representation generated automatically by a vectorizer, or specified at import time.

Weaviate lets you define vectorizers at the class level, with further control (e.g. specific model, or vectorization behavior) at the property level. Since you're bringing your own vectors, a vectorizer is not needed, so we will set the vectorizer to `none` here.

:::note Optional: Set a **compatible** vectorizer
If you're using "custom" vectors that utilize the same model available through a Weaviate module, you have the option to **designate that specific model and module** as the class vectorizer.<p><br/></p>

In this tutorial, the vectors were produced using the OpenAI model `ada-002`. As this model is also available through the `text2vec-openai` module, it may be set as the class vectorizer. Doing so will enable Weaviate to generate vectors if any objects are upserted without a vector, and enable the [`nearText` operator](../api/graphql/search-operators.md#neartext).<p><br/></p>

Note that if a class has a specified vectorizer but you provide a vector at the time of import, Weaviate will use your supplied vector.
:::

import CreateSchema from '/_includes/code/quickstart.byov.schema.mdx'

<CreateSchema />


## Import data with vectors

Here is the set of [10 pre-vectorized Jeopardy questions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/jeopardy_tiny+vectors.json) in JSON format.

The following will load the question objects with vectors, and import them to Weaviate.

Note that we use a batch import process, so that each request to the inference API contains multiple objects. You should use batch imports unless you have a good reason not to, as it will significantly improve the speed of data ingestion.

import ImportQuestionsWithVectors from '/_includes/code/quickstart.import.questions+vectors.mdx'

<ImportQuestionsWithVectors />

:::tip vector != object property
Do *not* specify object vectors as an object property. This will cause Weaviate to treat it as a regular property, rather than as a vector embedding.
:::

## Query

Let's say you want to find questions related to biology. We can do that by obtaining a vector embedding for "biology", and finding objects nearest to it.
In this example, we've used the OpenAI API to generate it, with the same [`text-embedding-ada-002` model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings). Then, in the following query, we pass that vector to the [`nearVector` operator](../api/graphql/search-operators.md#nearvector):

import NearVector from '/_includes/code/quickstart.query.nearVector.mdx';

<NearVector />

You should see something like this:

import BiologyQuestionsJson from '/_includes/code/quickstart/response.biology.questions.mdx';

<BiologyQuestionsJson />
